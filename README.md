# Qubit SIM Savings Helper - Landing Page

## Description

Qubit SIM Savings Helper is a simple landing page built to help users save money on mobile data. The page provides users with a free guide on how to optimize mobile data usage through eSIM/iSIM technology, along with a free consultation offer for early users.

The purpose of this landing page is to test the assumption that users are interested in tools and guides that help them reduce their data costs using eSIM and iSIM technology. The page includes a simple Call-To-Action (CTA) to encourage users to provide their contact information for early access to the guide or for free consultations.

This project was developed as part of a Lean Startup MVP to validate the product-market fit, assumptions, and hypotheses for Qubit, a telecom disruptor aiming to provide affordable mobile data solutions in Nigeria.
